# sqlalchemy-challenge
I used Python and SQLAlchemy to do a basic climate analysis and data exploration of your climate database. Specifically, using SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib to complete the needed steps.

I used the provided files (climate_starter.ipynb and hawaii.sqlite) to complete the climate analysis and data exploration, while using the SQLAlchemy create_engine() function to connect to my SQLite database.

I then made use of the SQLAlchemy automap_base() function to reflect my tables into classes, and then save references to the classes named station and measurement. I finally, linked Python to the database by creating a SQLAlchemy session.
